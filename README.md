I used Ionic & Angular to create this app and used GitHub to manage it from the command line.

This app was designed so the user could search a movie database and can select several movies as their favorites and to show them on a different page. I used a tabs template to start off my app.

As a plug in I tried to get a backlight to function, but I couldnâ€™t seem to get it to work.

For my login page I used code that I got from several YouTube channels and selected and edited for my own use on this project. I used a movie API for my database.

I had planned to show a background image to be displayed on the home page and then a purple gradient color in the About, Contact, Login and favorites pages. I could not get the path to work for me in this regard.
